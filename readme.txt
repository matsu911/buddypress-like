Gives users of a BuddyPress site the ability to 'like' activities, and soon other social elements of the site.

== Description ==

Adds a 'Like' button to activities in the stream, which shows how many people have 'liked' the item in brackets, and allows the logged in user to also 'like' it.

This is an initial release, and using feedback from the community I will be expanding the plugin to allow 'liking' of other social elements of BuddyPress.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bp-like` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
